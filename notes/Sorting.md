# Sorting
## Merge Sort

 - Merg sort is a **divide** and **conquer** algorithm.
 - Divide and Conquer recursively breaks down a problem into 2 or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
 - The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
 - **Divide** - In this step the algorithm takes middle point of an array and divides the array into 2 parts. The algorithm is carried out recursively for half arrays, until there are no more half arrays to deivide. 
 - **Conquer** - In this step starting from the bottom, we sort and merge the divided arrays and get the sorted array.
